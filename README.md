# watch_alarm_clock_app

Created an watch app with very basic clock_alarm_functionality which serves as a basis for my future GSOC Project Idea, by a GSOC Organization and an Open Source Organization, known as CCExtractor, Ultimate Alarm CLock Watch Companion App. This Project is a qualification task for Ultimate Alarm Clock Watch Companion App(UACWC).

Please go through this video demo of the app
